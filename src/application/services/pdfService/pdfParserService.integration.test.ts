const expectedMultiColumnPdfText1 = `What Makes A Great Software Engineer? Microsoft Seattle, WA The Information School University of Washington Abstract-Good software engineers are essential to the creation of good software. However, most of what we know about software-engineering expertise are vague stereotypes, such as excellent communicators and great teammates. The lack of specificity in our understanding hinders researchers from reasoning about them, employers from identifying them, and young engineers from becoming them. Our understanding also lacks breadth: what are all the distinguishing attributes of great engineers (technical expertise and beyond)? We took a first step in addressing these gaps by interviewing experienced engineers across divisions at Microsoft, uncovering attributes of great engineers. We explain the attributes and examine how the most salient of these impact projects and teams. We discuss implications of this knowledge on research and the hiring and training of engineers. Index Terms-Software engineers, expertise, teamwork 1. INTRODUCTION Software engineering research has considered a vast number of factors that affect project outcomes, from process and tools, to programming languages and requirement elicitation. We rarely give consideration, however, to one of the most fundamental components of software engineering: the engineers themselves. Specifically, what makes a software engineer great? This basic question is at the foundation of nearly every part of our worlds rapidly growing software ecosystem: employers want to hire and retain great engineers, universities want to train great engineers, and young engineers want to become great. And yet our understanding of what characteristics define software engineering expertise still lacks specificity, breadth, and rigor. The research we do have on this subject is directionally sound, but often too indirect or abstract to form a foundational understanding of software-engineering expertise. For example, some research has considered experiences of new hires. finding that engineers need to contribute value to the team, not become blocked (that is have self-efficacy and be persistent), and effectively navigate large organizations. Other research hints at important attributes, but only indirectly. For example, research on teaching novices and programmer productivity indicate experts are generally more productive: producing solutions faster, producing more in the same amount of time, and/or having fewer bugs. Software engineering education research is another source of information about software engineering expertise, but it is prescriptive rather than descriptive. For example, several studies suggest what ought to be in the ACM Computing Curricula. arguing that engineers need knowledge of technical areas and techniques such as programming fundamentals, verification/validation, and project management. In this study, we sought to remedy the lack of specificity, breadth, and rigor in prior work by investigating the following about software engineers: What do expert software engineers think are attributes of great software engineers? Why are these attributes important for the engineering of software? How do these attributes relate to each other? To answer these questions, we performed semi-structured interviews, spanning Microsoft divisions, including several interviews with architect-level engineers with over years of experience. The contribution of this effort is a thorough, specific, and contextual understanding of software engineering expertise, as viewed by expert software engineers. In the rest of this paper, we detail our current understanding of software engineering expertise. We then discuss our interview and analysis methodology, the attributes we discovered, and the implications of this knowledge for software engineering research, practice, and training. 2. RELATED WORK Much of our knowledge of software engineering expertise come from studying new engineers rather than experienced ones. For example, the closest work to ours is Hewner and Guzdials investigation of what employers in a small game company look for in new graduates. The authors interviewed and surveyed over engineers, managers, and artists about qualifications for recent graduates. The authors identified programming skills as well as people skills, like the ability to work with others and check your ego at the door. In addition to biases for the gaming industry, the authors also suggested differences in expectations between new and senior hires. Begel and Simons ICER paper performed a similar investigation. following new hires at Microsoft for weeks and examining their daily tasks. The authors found that novices need to identify tasks that have an impact, to be persistent (avoid lack of self-efficacy), and to collaborate effectively in a large-scale software team setting. However, it was unclear whether experienced engineers had similar issues. Some works are prescriptive, offering recommendations, but often providing few insights into why topics are (or are not) important. For example, Lethbridge surveyed software professionals about the relevance of computer science education topics from the ACM Computing Curricula. A notable exception is Kelleys work examining star performers, including software engineers at HP and Bell Labs. The authors prescribed nine working strategies and described how they lead to high productivity-blazing trails, knowing who knows, IEEE/ACM th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering /$31.IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICSE.2015.

Ko, Jiamin Zhu proactive self-management, getting the big picture, the right kind of followership, teamwork as joint ownership of a project, small-I leadership, street smarts, and show and tell. Other works have considered related occupations such as Information Technology and Information Systems. Many of the needs, like supporting existing portfolio of applications and analyze business problems and IS solutions were directed towards selecting software rather than creating it. Some insights into software engineering expertise have come from luminaries. At OOPSLA. Brechner-a director of development training at Microsoft-discussed the need for design analysis, embracing diversity (for example other nationalities), multidisciplinary project teaming, large-scale development, and quality code. Dijkstra, in his Turing Award speech. argued that good developers create obvious and elegant solutions, constructed with provable correctness. These attributes are likely important, but the luminaries were probably not aiming to exhaustively or rigorously identify key attributes. Popular press and best-practice guides have also considered the topic. In a New York Times interview. Bock-Googles vice president of people operations-indicated that a software engineers ability to learn on the job was critical, also claiming that human judgment, inspiration, and creativity were more important than technical knowledge. Similarly, McConnell argued that effective developers, in addition to technical skills, had various personality traits like being humble about their intelligence, curiosity, and intellectual honesty. Comparisons of novices and experts also reveal insight into software engineering expertise, showing that experts are more productive, systematic, and well-prepared. Sackman et al. in one of the first comparisons of developer productivity in. found that completion times of programming and debugging tasks can vary as much as 28:between the best and worst engineers. Researchers also suggest qualitative and environmental differences. Robillard et al. found that effective developers were more methodical and better at recognizing relevant information. Ericsson et al.-origin of the meme that 10,hours of deliberate practice is needed to achieve expertise-found that attaining expertise required time, materials, teachers, and facilities. Research into various aspects of teamwork suggests other important attributes. Simons research into effective organizations argued that setting, communicating, and alignment of goals within teams are important. Gobeli et al. found that effective conflict management (for example confronting and give and take) are important for successful projects. Research on collaborations suggests that expert software engineers have knowledge of code ownership, the technical domain, and argumentation skills. While related research is extensive, few works directly address software engineering expertise. Those that do, focus on a narrow subset of factors. In our work, we give greater breadth, depth, and rigor to our understanding of software engineering expertise than the current literature offers. 3. METHOD Ideally, an empirical study of software engineering expertise would sample a wide-range of software companies, software products, and company cultures. As an initial effort, we tried to approximate the ideal by interviewing experienced engineers at Microsoft, a large company with a diverse set of software products and engineers. We chose face-to-face semi-structured interviews to identify an exhaustive list of attributes with detailed and contextualized understanding of their meaning and importance. A key decision in our method was determining whose subjective opinions of software engineering expertise could be considered credible. Licensure and accreditation of engineers is still uncommon. The ACM's definition of software engineers as 'people who produce software for earnest use is vague. We therefore used the approach utilized by researchers of human expertise. basing our definition of expertise on people having achieved some degree of recognition as software engineering experts. We selected engineers at or above the Software Development Engineer Level (SDEII) title. These engineers were confirmed as experts by other engineers via the hiring or promotion processes. Based on prior work, we aimed to obtain a stratified random sample of engineers across two important dimensions: product type (major divisions at Microsoft plus one for all others including Skype, Data C enter Ops, and Distribution) and experience level (experienced-titles at or above SDEII-and very experienced-titles at or above Senior Dev Manager-typically with 15 years of experience). We used the corporate address book, which the st author had access to as a full time Microsoft employee. We randomly sampled engineers in the strata in a round-robin fashion with employees each round, aiming for at least informants in each stratum. Of the engineers we contacted, we interviewed (percent), see. The interviews were semi-structured and about hour in duration. We started by describing our study, explaining how we located the interviewee, asking permission to record the interview, informing them that all personally identifiable.

We began the interview by asking: I want to start by learning a bit more about you. What software products, at Microsoft and elsewhere, have you worked on? This helped us to establish rapport and facilitated informants reflections; this prior history was later removed during transcriptions to preserve anonymity. We then asked: Think back to someone you've worked with that you thought was a great software engineer. What were some attributes that made the person 'great' in your mind? We asked follow-up and clarification questions for attributes that we thought were interesting (for example novel, vague, or counter to prior informants). In the second part of the interview, we asked about attributes that either lacked clarity or (we thought) might vary in interpretation. As we learned more about the attributes from interviewees, we updated the set of attributes we inquired about (once every ~interviews). For time considerations, we limited our discussions to attributes of interest. We closed the interview by restating the purpose of the research and asking interviewees whether they had anything else to add. To analyze the more than hours of interviews and 388,words of transcripts, we used a grounded theory approach. We began with open coding, identifying and assessing all excerpts that discussed attributes of great software engineers. Once we developed our initial attributes, descriptions, and groupings, we made a selective coding pass through our data-consolidating the attribute set. To validate our interpretations, we then solicited the help of a Senior Software Development Engineer (rd author) to analyze roughly 1/of the interviews, developing her own attributes, definitions, and groupings, and then consolidating with the initial set. We made a final pass through all transcripts to produce the final set of attributes. 4. FINDINGS Our analysis identified a diverse set of attributes of great software engineers. At a high level, our informants described great engineers as people who are passionate about their jobs and are continuously improving; who develop and maintain practical decision-making models based on theory and experience; who grow their capability to produce software that are elegant, creative, and anticipate needs; who evaluate tradeoffs at multiple levels of abstraction, from low-level technical details to big-picture strategies; and whom teammates trust and enjoy working with. To give readers a sense of how the attributes interconnect, we present a model of the attributes in Fig 1. We organize the attributes into internal attributes of the engineers personality and ability to make effective decisions, as well as external attributes of the impact that great engineers have on people and product. Making effective decisions involved recognizing situations as well as knowing alternative courses of action, likely outcomes, and values of outcomes. The external attributes focused on great engineers applying their emotional intelligence and decision-making models to their software, their teammates, and the potentially millions of users and stakeholders they serve via their software engineering efforts. Many of the attributes are applicable to many professions, and some, to simply being a good person. Our objective was to identify, among all possible attributes, the set that expert software engineers viewed as important for the engineering of software. More importantly, we aimed to provide a contextualized understanding of why these attributes are important in real-world practice. In the rest of this section, we provide a description of each attribute and quotes from informants (including their title and division when this information would not reveal their identity) that capture the sentiment in interviews. Due to space limitations, we focus detailed descriptions on attributes that we felt-based on prior work-were particularly interesting. A. Personal Characteristics Informants mentioned attributes of engineers personalities (see ). With attributes like passionate and curious, these concerned who great engineers were as people. For many attributes, informants felt that the attributes were intrinsic to the engineer-formed through their upbringing-and were difficult (if not impossible) to change. Model of attributes of great software engineers, with attributes we discuss in detailed in bold. ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy 1) Improving Informants described great engineers as improving: not satisfied with the status quo and constantly looking to improve themselves, their product, and/or their surroundings. Informants believed that engineers did not start their careers being great, but that young engineers needed to learn and improve. Informants also felt that because the software field was rapidly changing and evolving, unless engineers kept learning, they would not become and would not continue to be great software engineers. This notion of running up an infinite escalator was prevalent among informants: Computer technology, compared to other sciences or technology, it's pretty young. Every year there's some new technology, new ideas. If you are only satisfied with things you already learned, then you probably find out in a few years, you're out of date good software engineer. he keep investigate, investment.-SDE2, Corp Dev 2) Passionate Informants described great engineers as passionate: intrinsically interested in the area they are working in, and not just for extrinsic rewards such as money. Informants felt that software engineering required a tight fit between a person's passion and the project to achieve high quality: I think that there are people who are great software engineers who are in the wrong place and aren't motivated and they end up not performing well.-Principal Dev Lead, Dynamics There was also a sentiment that no matter the subject matter, there will be someone with a natural affinity towards it: I found that there's always a person who's passionate about every type of thing, you just have to find the right people I ended up in the wrong job for six months. It was painful. People around me, they loved their work-Principal Dev Lead, Phone 3) Open-minded Informants described great engineers as open-minded: willing to judiciously let new information change how they think, not taking the current understanding as gospel. Informants felt that outcomes in software engineering (for example user reactions and commercial success) were difficult to predict: You should be open what you think need not be the right thing tomorrow like the Facebook explosion, when Myspace was already there, but it exploded no one knew that Facebook would explode when it started.-Senior SDE, Windows Services. PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GREAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. ATTRIBUTES DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ARE IN BOLD. Attribute and description Excerpt that capture interviewees sentiment Improving-not satisfied with the status quo: constantly looking to improve themselves, their product, and/or their surroundings. Always looking to do something better, always looking for the next thing, studying about the newer thing to do things better.-Senior Dev Lead, Xbox Passionate-intrinsically interested in the area they are working in (that is not just in it for extrinsic rewards like a pay check). You can't be a great engineer and not enjoy what you're doing to wouldn't make you a great engineernot just to get a paycheck.-Principal SDE, Xbox Open-minded-willing to judiciously let new information change how they think. The problem is. not being willing to take the input of othersnot invented here, thats a huge problem.-Principal Dev Lead, Office Data-driven-taking and evaluating measurements of their actions and of the software, often relative to expectations. The difference between fact and hypothesis How can I prove that? A new fact might show up, that this proves what I thought was my theory.-Principal Dev Lead, Xbox Systematic-taking actions in logical and ordered steps Have to be patient and not rush to the solution. go through a mental gymnastics in order to get to a solution.-Principal SDE Lead, Windows Productive-achieving the same results as others faster, or taking the same amount of time as others but doing more. He codes quickly and fast Just write the code and figure out how to get it working.-Principal Dev Manager, Bing Perseverant-not discouraged by setbacks and failures. I will try to find out a solution. Those people always succeed There is always a way.-Senior Dev Lead, Dynamics Hardworking-working more than is expected to finish deliverables and/or to accomplish their improvement goals. Sometimes thats just arduous. You really just need to grind through-SDE2, Server and Tools Curious-wanting to know how and why things happen (that is how the code and the conditions produce a software behavior or customer reaction). I was always asking why. Why does that thing work? Why does it do this? What is it? For me, I kind of had to have a need to know what made something tick and it's that curiosity-Technical Fellow, division removed to preserve anonymity Risk-taking-willing to go into high-value areas even though they may not have knowledge or expertise (for example new technologies). They're willing to take on the challenge. So that's the most important one.-Senior Dev Lead, Bing Adaptable-adapting to changes in their environment, including changes in what they do (for example the software product) and how they do it (for example people, processes, and tools). Things are going to change, what are you going to do about that? move forward adapt to work with what you have to work with?-SDE2, Service Engineering Self-reliant-getting things done independently (that is not always going to their manager for help); removing roadblocks by leveraging their abilities and resources (for example asking experts for help). Rather than looking around for somebody to solve it for them. try to figure out how they can do this on their own get yourself unblocked attitude works really well.-Principal SDE, Windows Self-aware-continuously assessing ones situation and taking corrective actions when necessary. A little bit of an intuition being able to recognize this ain't working, I better start over.-Principal Dev Lead, Xbox Aligned-acting for the good of the product and the organization, not for ones own self-interest. A mismatch of value their number one goal is really to learn you are paid because we are a business.-Principal Dev Manager, Windows Services Executing-knowing when to execute; no analysis paralysis They should not get into analysis paralysis most optimal solution for the problem on hand, not the most accurate solution.-SDE2, Phone Prideful-taking pride in oneself and ones product; letting their output be a reflection of their skills and trying their best to deliver. Really being able to demonstrate something that you've done, that you're really proud of it's quality work.-Principal Dev Lead, Xbox Creating-wanting to bring ideas and thoughts into reality (for example a software product or a feature). They feel more accomplished at the end of the day if theyve actually built something designed something, maybe they wrote some code.-Senior SDE, Windows Focused-allocating and prioritizing their time for the most impactful work. In an environment like Microsoft where theres a lot of meeting and interruptions get focus and when to get their focus.-Principal Dev Lead, Xbox ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy Informants also felt that because software products were large, complex, and constantly changing; it was rare for anyone to have a complete understanding. Therefore, even great engineers needed to be open to changing their understanding: No matter how much you know, the software industry is so large theres so many other areas If that person has something to say that hadnt occurred to me, Ill stop everything and say, ok, explain this. What did you see, that I didnt see?-Senior SDE, Office 4) Data-driven Several informants described great engineers as data-driven: taking and evaluating measurements of their actions and of the product, creating behavioral feedback loops for optimizing software and processes. Informants believed that decisions, when possible, should be made using data, not intuition or arguments. Many viewed this approach as a way to avoid confirmation bias, but lamented that it was no panacea: One thing that surprises me even though we are driven by data, at least we try to believe we are Some data gets shown to us. We figure out some ways to ignore it. So, maybe, maybe everybody thinks that theyre data driven, but Ive seen people come up with excuses for why the data doesnt apply to them. Ive seen that a million times.-Senior SDE, Office B. Decision Making Informants mentioned attributes of engineers ability to decide (see ): synthesizing the current context, decision alternatives, probabilistic outcomes, and values of outcomes. Informants felt strongly that having book knowledge was not sufficient; great engineers understood how decisions play-out in complicated real-world conditions. Great engineers not only knew what should happen, but also what can and likely will happen. To make effective decisions, our informants discussed engineers needing knowledge about context along several dimensions-technical domain, customers and business, tools and building materials, and engineering practices-as foundational to engineering decisions. We detail one area of knowledge, people and organizations, because it had insights into interpersonal dynamics not often discussed in the literature. We also discuss engineers updating their mental models, seeing the forest and the trees, and handling complexity. Informants insights into these attributes revealed that great engineers have complex and multi-faceted decision-making models that were continuously being updatedition This reflected the complex decisions that great engineers often had to make. 1) Knowledgeable about people and the organization Informants described great engineers as knowledgeable about people and the organization. This included being informed about their coworkers responsibilities, knowledge, and tendencies. For example, knowing ownership enabled great engineers to determine key stakeholders for decisions and to communicate with the right people to align their work. This alignment commonly meant their management chain, but informants also discussed aligning with key partner teams (for example other parts of a product offering): Make sure that you are aware of that big picture, you know where you fit in and how you interact with everyone else to optimize what you are doing.-Principal Dev Lead, Ad Platform Knowing who had expertise enabled great engineers to find the right people for help-often domain experts-and for great engineers in leadership positions, to take corrective actions to address knowledge gaps (for example assigning a more senior person): would go through his organization and looked very carefully at the tasks that were being assigned and whether people had the right level of training and understanding and if they didnt, who their supervisor and whether that person did and would demand code reviews.-Software Architect (division removed to preserve anonymity). DECISION MAKING OF GREAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. ATTRIBUTES DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ARE IN BOLD. Attribute and description Excerpt that capture interviewees sentiment Knowledgeable about people and the organization-informed about the people around them: their responsibilities (that is organizational structure), their knowledge, and their tendencies Companies like Microsoft, there's literally people here who have created a world, the technological world that we live in today. Theyre stars in that regard tap into this wealth of knowledge that Microsoft brings to the table, the talent pool thats here.-SDE2, Xbox Sees the forest and the trees-considering situations at multiple levels, including technical details, industry trends, company vision, and customer/business needs Both a very, very narrow extremely technical prospective on his code, but also know where it fits in with the bigger picture, and to be aware of how it affects even our major external customers, and the company vision.-Principal SDE, Windows Updates their mental models-keeping up to-to-date their mental models through evaluating changes in their context Unlearning two thirds or three quarters of what you know is still valuable, quarter to a third is the wrong thing in this world and so the trick is to figure out which is which really quickly.-Technical Fellow, division removed to preserve anonymity Handles complexity-able to grasp and reason about complex and intertwining ideas Frighteningly intelligent and smart, and they just walk around with this picture in their head all the time of how everything fits together.-Principal SDE, Windows Knowledgeable about their technical domain-thoroughly conversant about their software product, including knowledge about the domain and competitors You should have a very good understanding of the entire system as well as all of the moving parts the architects behind big systems, complex systems, and know it, all the gotchas, in and out.-Senior SDE, Windows Services Knowledgeable about customers and business-conversant about the role their software product plays in the lives of their customer and the business proposition that entails Really understanding the point like who is the customer, why are we doing this.-Principal Dev Lead, Xbox Knowledgeable about tools and building materials-versed in strengths and limitations of the tools and building materials used to construct their software product The fundamentals, you've got to learn your . data structure, algorithm stuff inside out because everything else is building on them.-Partner Dev Manager, Corp Dev Knowledgeable about engineering processes-skilled in best practices for building the product: their purpose, how to do them effectively, and their cost in time and effort Having good practices around, how you do the code reviews and check ins and having unit tests that enforces things dont break and that kind of thing it is way, way more important than the actual having a beautiful architecture.-Principal Dev Lead. Windows Services Models states and outcomes-building mental models linking the current state, alternative actions, probabilistic outcomes, and value of outcomes I think that mostly just comes from experience learning where the hard parts of the problems are probably lurking and what trouble they might cause you or something like that having a good pattern of recognition-Principal Dev Lead, Corp Dev ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy Knowing peoples tendencies enabled great engineers to adapt their engagement techniques to obtain desired outcomes: You have to understand people so that you can influence or impact them. You have to do that both down and up and out.-Principal Dev Lead, Phone 2) Sees the Forest and the Trees Informants described great engineers as seeing the forest and the trees, considering situations at multiple levels of abstraction, including technical details, industry trends, company vision, and customer/business needs. Informants indicated that mental models could exist at various levels and that great engineers reasoned at all levels quickly and accurately: What differentiated from other people in management positions capability to zoom into the details, and he was not just a high level guy, know the reality of the stack or the reality of the software-Senior Dev Lead, Ad Platform Informants felt that this ability enabled great engineers to make globally optimal decisions, avoiding local optimizations: The challenge is having the ability to look at things from many different perspectives, at many different levels of abstraction or detail. Then, being able to choose how to lay things out make a set of choices.-Technical Fellow (division removed to preserve anonymity) 3) Update Their Mental Models Informants described great engineers as continuously updating their mental models at all levels of abstraction-ranging from technical details to industry trends-by explicitly evaluating changes in their context. Related to being open-minded, this attribute concerned the process of updating mental models, sometimes discarding existing models for new ones: You can always follow patterns too much. It's worked in the past, but conditions have changedition You always need to look and take a little bit of risk with each one of your tasks. If you're not then you're not really going to find out what's possible.-Principal Dev Lead, Office Important contextual changes discussed by informants were commonly shifts in long-held understandings in software. Informants felt that these foundational shifts and their implications were critical for great engineers to understand and adapt to: Sometimes what used to be a second or third order effect comes to dominate. So way back in the day, if you wanted to performance optimize something you counted instructions. Processors got faster and faster, but memory references didn't. There became a day when it made more sense to count memory references than it did to count instructions. Unless you're conscious of when those things will intersect, you'll be on the wrong side of history and be frustrated.-Technical Fellow (division removed to preserve anonymity) 4) Handling Complexity Many informants described great engineers as handling complexity with ease, grasping and reasoning about complex and intertwining ideas with agility. Informants felt that some software problems were inherently complex. This might have been especially salient at Microsoft, where products commonly build on top of multiple layers of technologies and interact with many other components. Building an accurate mental model of dependencies and connections was seen as critical: To solve the problem, have to have the ability to connect things You are always debugging layers of stacks of code this layer talks to some other layer in the horizontal. you need to solve the problem and you don't know what's going on.-Senior SDE, Windows Services Some informants felt that the ability to handle complexity was a natural ability. Others felt that great engineers could effectively augment their natural abilities using tools and processes (for example externalizing knowledge by writing it down): Ability to capture simulate the architecture in their head there's probably a little bit of innate skill and cognitive ability That said, the fact that you don't have that skill doesn't mean that there's no other ways of doing it that may be more brute force writing things down and studying very carefully the architecture you've put down is putting the brute force time into studying a problem.-Partner Dev Lead, Windows C. Teammates Informants mentioned attributes of engineers interactions with teammates (see ). Informants felt that great engineers were expected to positively impact teammates. For many informants, this was an important part of their job as leads or managers. Attributes in this area revolved around four concepts: being a reasonable person, being a good leader, communicating effectively, and building trust. We discuss, in detail, attributes related to communicating effectively and building trust, as these concepts are frequently mentioned in the literature but often with little contextual understanding. 1) Creates Shared Context Informants felt that creating shared context, which involved molding another persons understanding of a situation, was the most important aspect of communicating effectively. This involved tailoring the message to another persons perspective: You perceive who you are talking to, and you are able to judge on those levels that they are, or you just ask important questions. Do you know about this? And then, be able to simplify the problem to the level that theyre working in, or you estimate the amount of information given to them.-Senior SDE, Windows This sentiment is closely related to the concept of grounding proposed by Clark and Brennan, which, when done successfully, required parties to coordinate the content and the process of communication. Since the engineering of software involves many people, getting everyone to have a shared understanding was seen as essential to success: One person can only accomplish so much so you've always got to be working as part of the bigger groupage People who can't communicate are only going to be sort of so-so effective-Principal Dev Lead, Corp Dev Informants also stated that great engineers, especially ones at higher-levels, often had to communicate with people that do not have a complete (or the same) understanding of the situation but are critical to success (for example partner teams, customers, or management). Therefore, crafting the message such that others can comprehend the situation was important: Our areas where the things are inherently difficult to talk about business partners or with a customer When you go outside and you talk to customers, they think about things in much different terms and so in some ways you have to kind of switch gears why you should care about it and here is how you should think about it.-Principal Dev Lead, Corp Dev 2) Creates Shared Success Informants described great engineers as creating shared success for everyone involved, possibly involving personal compromises. Informants felt that software engineering was a collaborative process, requiring many people, often with different personal motivations and organizational objectives. G reat engineers needed to get everyone making decisions aligned to a shared goal: ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy No matter how good is our code, if our partner cannot give it a good product for us then we cannot share our greatness to the whole world. A lot of time I see our support to our client is not very well we should have a good result combined together.-Senior SDE, Phone Many informants said that great engineers made shared success bidirectional between managers and individual contributors. Managers needed to put engineers in positions to succeed; great engineers needed to engage management to facilitate mutual success. G reat engineers often had better understandings of the details; managers often had a broader perspective of the situation: It's a two-way communication there's something going to happen down the road, this piece of code or this feature going to have some issues, need to make your manager aware.-SDE2, Phone This attribute likely helped to avoid dysfunctional time famine situations as discussed by Perlow. where crises arise in teams due to a lack of shared understanding about status and objectives. 3) Creates A Safe Haven Many informants described great engineers as creating a safe haven where other engineers can learn and improve from mistakes and situations without negative consequences. Usually associated with leaders, informants felt that if engineers are afraid of mistakes, then their growth would slow: Chasing after a career path or something you will deliver your best performance if you are not insecure One of the challenges as a manager people face these days is retaining talent because there is so much attrition all over.-Senior Dev Lead, Ad Platform Informants also saw the lack of this attribute as a major contributing factor for talent loss. Informants did not want to work in environments where they felt insecure, and often avoided those teams/organizations: If you make one mistake or dont know something and youre sort of dinged by that and youre only judged if you say everythings perfect even if it isnt Then you start to have this really kind of I think dysfunctional environment set up where everybody just doesnt say the truth.-Principal Dev Manager, Windows Services. G REAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ENGAGEMENT WITH TEAMMATES. ATTRIBUTES DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ARE IN BOLD. Attribute and description Excerpt that capture interviewees sentiment Creates shared context-molding another persons understanding of the situation while tailoring the message to be relevant and comprehensible to the other person. Most compellingly relate the value of that abstraction as it goes to non-abstract to very abstract to each person empathize with your audience. get them to get it.-SDE2, Windows Creates shared success-enabling success for everyone involved, possibly involving personal compromises. Find the common good in a solution express heres the value for you. Its a win-win situation.-Senior Dev Lead, Windows Creates a safe haven-creating a safe setting where engineers can learn and improve from mistakes and situations without negative consequences. If you learn something from a failure, thats a wonderful sort of thing If youre afraid of getting smacked upside the head encourage the people to experiment, possibly succeed, possibly fail.-Senior SDE, Office Honest-truthful (that is no sugar coating or spinning the situation for their own benefit). When you do make mistakes, you've got admit you made a mistake. If you try to cover up or kind of downplayed mistake, everybody will see it, it's super obvious. It affects your effectiveness.-Partner Dev Manager, Corp Dev Integrates contexts-integrating different contexts together into their own understanding, including noticing and asking questions about gaps and incongruities. Disparate ideas and pieces of information put pieces together asking good questions. organize your thoughts that will help you make those connections.-Principal Dev Lead, Dynamics Well-mannered-treating others with respect, not obnoxious about their title, accolades, or knowledge. Smart but not cocky Hes the one who knows all the information. He never comes across that way make the other people seem like, Oh, I feel so stupid.-Senior SDE, Windows Services Acquires context-effectively acquiring contexts and knowledge from others. To get the software to work each things need to be integrate together . learn from others and you need to know the things others are working on.-SDE2, Corp Dev Not making it personal-divorcing oneself from personal feelings and biases. You can have a very open and heated discussions. But it is all very professional; none of this is ever taken personally.-Principal Dev Lead, Server and Tools Mentoring-instilling knowledge to others; helping others improve. Hes seen stuff that you havent seen yet, and hes willing to share his knowledge Lets spread some of that good knowledge around.-Senior SDE, Office Raises challenges-pushing others to action, expanding the teams limits. Shared confidence: so it's like he's done it and so you can do it spark your imagination and your sense of self confidence for you to boot strap yourself upage-SDE2, Windows Walking-the-walk-acting as the exemplar (for example using good practices) for others to follow. I would like to model myself against that behavior (of a great software engineer) it inspires me to do the same thing.-Senior Dev Lead, Ad Platform Manages expectations-setting clear expectations, updating them, and then delivering on them. Your leads, your managers setting expectations, they know what youre going to do, you do it.-SDE2, Servers and Tools Has a good reputation-having the belief, respect, and confidence of others to make good decisions. Build up that reputation and that trust through your years worth of good deeds essentially, so that when you make that recommendation, they go, I am going to listen to him.-Principal Dev Manager, Windows Services Stands their ground-firm against outside pressure (for example management), when appropriate, based on sound principles He will say no, if he has to. If what they're asking him to do jeopardizes something else stand up and be brave about it.-Principle SDE, Windows Trading favors-creating personal equity with others. Returning a favor here and there above and beyond to help somebody else out and then somewhere down the road that person has that extra good will to come help you out.-Senior Dev Lead, Windows Personable-cool people that one would engage with in a non-work setting. One of the characteristics I look for in every person that I get Can I have a beer with this guy? but theyre very, very stubborn and you know that you can only put them on one thing and thats it.-SDE2, Servers and Tools Asks for help-finding and engaging others with needed knowledge and information. He does his homework and anything that he doesn't know he goes and finds a person that does know. He doesn't try to know it all himself.-Principal SDE, Windows ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy Though informants felt that safe havens were important, many expressed the need to balance a safe environment with feeling the pain of mistakes. The reasoning was that pain from mistakes was the best teacher: if an engineer was hurt by something, then the engineer quickly learned to avoid it: I believe in having people feel the pain of their own mistakes dealing with the ramifications of the decisions that are being made, I guess is the best way to learn.-Principal Dev Lead, Office 4) Honest Informants felt that being honest was the most important attribute related to trust. This was about great engineers providing credible information. Engineers that presented a version of the situation that suited their own benefits were viewed negatively. Informants felt that they needed to be able to take action based on information that an engineer provided: Influence comes to someone else trusting you, part of that trust is that they go, You know what? I know that this person always speaks the truth. As a result of that, when they say something is good, I will totally believe them because they are not trying to kind of misrepresent something or make them look better or whatever.-Windows Services Principal Dev Manager Informants also did not appreciate wasting time shifting the blame for problems. They felt that great engineers focused their attention and efforts on addressing the problem: Rather than thinking about how to actually fix the problem at hand, more like How do I make sure that nobody will come back and think that maybe that happened because of something that I might have done? has a way of kind of saying: It doesn't matterWhat matters is right now. How do we actually work through it?-Senior SDE, Windows D. Software Product Informants mentioned attributes regarding the software that great engineers produced (see ). Like artists appreciating masterpieces of other artists, our informants, many of whom are great engineers themselves, saw beauty in the software produced by other great engineers. 1) Elegant Informants described software of great engineers as elegant: possessing simple and intuitive designs that another person (or themselves later) could easily understand. Among all software-related attributes, elegance was the most reveredition Informants recognized that some problems in software were complex and highly constrained, making it difficult to have a simple solution that met the requirements: The style always, an idea, and it was all clean very concise. Just looking at it, you can say, Okay, this guy, he knew what he was doing. There's no extra stuff. Everything is minimally necessary and sufficient as it should be. It's well thought-out off screen.-Windows, Senior SDE Informants also felt that it was critical to avoid complexity. Complex solutions increased the likelihood of bugs and increased maintenance costs (if problems were fixable at all). Evolving the software was also more costly when the design was brittle to change: Never complicate any things when you simplify things it becomes easier for you to maintain, going forward for customers You get lesser number of issues reported by a customer.-Senior Dev Lead, Dynamics 2) Creative Many informants described the software of great engineers as creative, involving novel solutions based on understanding of the constraints of the context, existing solutions, and the limitations of existing solutions. Informants felt that there were two important parts to having creative solutions. First, great engineers understood constraints and requirements of the particular context/problem: If you're looking for really an innovative or just a solution thats outside the current norm think through the problemconstraints that are currently imposed on the environment.-Principal SDE Lead, Windows Second, great engineers knew of and knew when to apply existing solutions (and not be creative). This was important because informants felt that known solutions were generally preferable since they were less costly and less error-prone: You are now using all of your creativity to reinvent things that are already invented and that is just basically wasteful.-Principal Dev Manager, Windows Services Still, most informants felt that novel problems occurred frequently in software engineering, needing great engineers with the ability to come up with innovative solutions: : G REAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS SOFTWARE AND DESIGNS. ATTRIBUTES DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ARE IN BOLD. Attribute and description Excerpt that capture interviewees sentiment Elegant-simple and intuitive (that is not complex) software/designs that others can understand. They are simple. very easy to understand in a sense that its very simple. Doing something well and in a very simple way is very very hard.-Principal Dev Lead, Bing Creative-novel solutions based on understanding of the context, existing solutions, and the limitations of existing solutions. Think outside the box here's a traditional solution often have constraints.take the difficult circumstance and actually make it into something that could actually still work, but without a huge complex overhead.-Senior SDE, Principal Dev Lead Anticipates needs-producing software that accommodate likely needs and problems based on contextual knowledge Think where you're going to get into trouble potentially What are we ultimately trying to do, and what can I do today that will save me time over the lifetime of the system?-Technical Fellow, division removed to preserve anonymity Makes tradeoffs-making trade-offs (for example quality for time to market) based on the context and the situation. Weight the tradeoffs. Is this really the right thing to do?-Principal SDE Lead, Windows Attentive to details-paying attention to coding details during development including error handling, memory consumption, performance, and style. The quality of the code, performance, space, and how many bugs it has, how robust it is, and how it handles exceptions will have great differences.-SDE2, Severs and Tools Fitted-thought-through designs that take the context (for example other components) into consideration. You understand better, interactions around you or around your code. How your code is supposed to work if I tweaked this here Im not going to break something else.-Senior Dev Lead, Xbox Evolving-structure the software to be efficiently delivered iteratively or in pieces. A very clean step-wise process moving forward how can we break this down so that we have really concrete deliverables on an ongoing basis.-Senior Dev Lead, Bing Long-termed-acting with an eye towards the future, not just short term gratification. A bunch of isolated, fragmented, short-term solutions together, what do you get? Not something great. Definitely, someone needs to have this long-term vision and say: we make decisions not based on the immediate problem-Partner Dev Manager, Corp Dev Carefully constructed-using the right processes (for example unit testing) to produce the software. Unit testing, of the code. Well before that was fashionable almost no bugs ever found in the product and that was actually his track record.-Senior Dev Manager, Windows ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy Understanding patterns and understanding how to apply something is very important so you dont recreate wheels all the time when there isnt an obvious pattern Are you creative enough come up with something new?-Senior Dev Lead, Windows 3) Anticipates Needs Many informants described software of great engineers as anticipating needs, accommodating possible future requirements not known at the time when the software was initially produced. Informants commonly mentioned scale (for example more users), feasibility (for example technology advancing to the point where new things were possible), and integration (e.g. working together with additional software products): QQ, the Chinese chat program. It now has hundreds of millions of users. That system was designed fifteen years ago, when QQ only had a few million users. It still works today, thats amazing, to have a system that scales that well, to foresee all the issues it would have to face.-SDE2, Severs and Tools More than any other attribute, informants discussed the propensity to overly anticipate needs in the face of uncertainty, incurring high costs to add unneeded flexibility. Some thought that any prediction of the future was foolish and preferred to design for current needs and being open to rewrites: .Architect something now that's going to survive well years from now? Nobody is that smart to be able to predict the future that well, I will refactor towards new requirements and I constantly do that.-Senior SDE, Office 5. THREATS TO VALIDITY As with any empirical study, our results are subject to various threats to validity. There are threats to the construct validity from the lack of a clear and shared definition of a software engineer. Though, in general, informants understood that we meant people that wrote code to be used by customers, and we clarified whenever there was confusion. Our interview and analysis processes contain threats to internal validity. Informants could generally only mention a few salient attributes unprompted; given more time to think, informants may have produced more attributes. Moreover, while our analysis was systematic, other researchers may discern different attributes, definitions, or models than ours. Our sampling method also contain threats to external validity. Though our interviews yielded rich insights, it was a small sample, even for Microsoft, which employs tens of thousands of engineers. This led to some natural biases, such as underrepresentation of women; we had only among our informants. In addition, we only sampled engineers in Seattle, USA. Findings may not generalize to other cultures, especially attributes associated with management. The size of the organization may also affect generalizability, especially for attributes related to people and organizations. Microsoft also had an established set of practices, tools, and products; findings may not generalize to other situations (for example start-ups). Microsoft is a software-centric company; informants discussed unfavorable conditions in non-software centric industries, like finance and retail. It is unclear whether the same attributes (or their standards) would generalize. Nonetheless, since Microsoft is a successful organization that produces software used by billions, findings are relevant and interesting. 6. DISCUSSION Overall, nearly all of the attributes of great software engineers we uncovered have been mentioned to some degree in prior work, for example. and many attributes overlap with ones important to other professions, for example. Our results, however, are the first time a comprehensive set of attributes for software engineering has been identified and described. In addition, there are several important implications. First, our results suggest that productivity is only one criterion for excellence. How the engineering is conducted, relative to management (for example managing expectations), subordinates (for example creating a safe haven), teammates (for example asking for help), partners (for example creating shared success), and even oneself (for example perseverant), are all critical. This reinforces the perspective that software engineering is a sociotechnical undertaking, and not just a technical one. Furthermore, simply delivering the code is also insufficient. With attributes like elegant, creative, long-termed, and seeing the forest and the trees, our results indicate that good software engineering requires engineers to make complex, experienced-driven, contextual considerations. Second, though rarely discussed in the software engineering literature, results suggest that effective decision-making is critical. Informants felt that there are usually myriad options-not all good-for what to do and how to do it. And as engineers grow in their careers, they are tasked with making decisions in increasingly more complex and ambiguous situations, often with significant ramifications. Making effective decisions, entailing attributes in Section 4.B as well as other sections, is an important skill for engineers to developage Third, results suggest that being able to learn new technical skills is likely more important than any individual technical skills. Informants, even ones in the same division, used diverse technologies-sometimes project specific tools (for example Cosmos, a Microsoft version of Hadoop). There was no consensus on any specific technical topic (for example architecture) as being essential. Rather, most informants stressed needing to learn new skills (that is continuously improving) and nearly all viewed it as a critical attribute of great engineers. The attributes we have identified and described may have wide-ranging implications for researchers, novice engineers, managers, and educators. In the rest of this section, we discuss implications and opportunities to build upon our results. A. For Researchers Our findings raise important questions about our current understanding of what affects software engineering outcomes. Much of the prior work on this topic focuses on processes. cost-estimation (for example COCOMO ), coordination. and requirements engineering. While many of the attributes we uncovered underlie these concerns, such as creating shared context and carefully constructed, there are also others that have not been considered, such as aligned, creates a safe haven, and fits. These likely reflect higher-level concerns such as individuality, organizations, and productization. Our results also suggest several new directions for tools research. For example, we are not aware of any tools that help engineers be more well-mannered in emails or evaluate tradeoffs and see the forest and the trees when making decisions. Tools research may explore facilitating and training engineers, especially novices, in these attributes ICSE 2015, Florence, Italy An important part of better understanding these attributes is developing measurements that operationalize these attributes. These may enable rigorous science to better understand how the attributes vary and their effects on teams and outcomes. Such measurements may also form a critical foundation for managers to identify and cultivate talent, for novices to improve, and for educators to assess learning outcomes. B. For Novice Engineers New software engineers are often unsure of how to become great engineers. Our findings enumerate a set of attributes that they might aspire to achieve. Improvements might come from trainings, projects at work, mentoring, or self-adjustments (for example for personality traits). Researchers might also investigate interventions that help achieve the attributes quickly and effectively. Furthermore, novice engineers may also use our results to assess their fit with prospective employers. As mentioned in Section 4.A.on passionate, the fit of the engineer with the project is critical. Novice engineers might assess their fit, in terms of the attributes they value, with a prospective team. Our findings may also help novices better present themselves to employers. Since experienced engineers and managers value these attributes, novice engineers might consider demonstrating to employers that they have or can develop these attributes. This also extends to highlighting the qualities when authoring their resumes or presenting themselves in interviews. C. For Managers Our informants discussed many attributes that were important for engineers in senior and leadership positions, such as mentoring, raising challenges, and walking-the-walk. New research may explore ways to help engineers improve these attributes to become better managers. Beyond improving themselves, our results may also help managers make more effective hiring decisions. Managers may better identify candidates that fit the culture and context of the team. They may also better avoid engineers without the attributes, such as not aligned (off doing their own projects), not well-mannered (being an ass, as many engineers described it), or not asking for help. Finally, our results strongly suggest that managers may consider cultivating the attributes within their teams. Managers may consider using the findings-with help from further research-to build a culture that is conducive to attracting, producing, and retaining great engineers. D. For Educators Our findings also raise significant questions about curriculum choices, teaching methods, and learning objectives in formal computer science and software engineering education. Educators may consider adding courses on topics not found in their current curricula. For example, we found decision making to be a key part of software engineering, but this specific topic is not a part of the ACMs Computing Curricula. A course specifically about decision making (for example discussing Simons model of rational choice. Kleins naturalistic decision-making approach. or case studies of software engineering decisions), might be valuable to students. Software engineering educators might also use our results to examine their teaching methods. Most attributes of great engineers focus on how rather than what, whereas most instructions in software engineering focus on teaching skills and knowledge (the what), such as prior work on tools for automated testing and analysis. Educators might consider improving how software engineering goals are attainedition For example, existing project-based courses might use attributes presented in this paper to help student evaluate each others behavior, as well as grading non-functional attributes of the code, such as elegance, anticipates needs, and creative. Finally, educators might consider explicitly discussing what students will not learn in school, allowing them to be aware of potential knowledge gaps and empower them to seek out opportunities outside of the academic setting (for example internships or open-source projects). For example, attributes like self-reliant may not be reasonable to teach in an academic setting and might be better learned through mentorship on the job; nevertheless, educators should consider informing students that it is a critical component of software engineering expertise. 7. FUTURE WORK Though this paper is a good start at better understanding software engineering expertise, there are countless opportunities for future work. The combinations of attributes that are interesting or prevalent could be examinedition Each specific attribute we uncovered in this study could also be the subject of future empirical studies to provide deeper and more nuanced definitions, approaches for measurement, or assessments of impacts on software engineering outcomes. Comparison of the attributes of software engineering expertise to attributes in other fields could provide more insights into the unique qualities of the software engineering phenomenon. Our results provide little insight into the relative importance of the attributes (for example weighting or criticality) and the effects of contextual factors (for example gender or background). We did not conduct an analysis for those insights for our interview study because it would have lacked validity. We did not ask informants about all the attributes, and informants often agreed or amended their thinking when prompted with attributes from other interviews. Future studies can examine this rich area. With studies like these and the many others that our findings provoke, our research community can begin to understand software engineering not just as a purely technical discipline of tools and processes, but a sociotechnical one, with individual human contributors and their collaborations fueling software progress.

Both terms are frequently used in science and media, sometimes interchangeably, sometimes with different meanings. In this work, we aim to clarify the relationship between these terms and, in particular, to specify the contribution of machine learning to artificial intelligence. We review relevant literature and present a conceptual framework which clarifies the role of machine learning to build (artificial) intelligent agents. Hence, we seek to provide more terminological clarity and a starting point for (inter-disciplinary) discussions and future research. 1. Introduction In his US senate hearing in April 2018, Mark Zuckerberg stressed the necessary capabilities of Facebooks AI tools to identify hate speech or terrorist propaganda. Researchers would typically describe such tasks of identifying specific instances within social media platforms as classification tasks within the field of (supervised) machine learning . However, with rising popularity of artificial intelligence (AI). the term AI is often used interchangeably with machine learning-not only by Facebooks CEO in the example above or in other interviews. but also across various theoretical and application-oriented contribu-tions in recent literature . Carner even states that he still uses AI as a synonym for machine learning although knowing this is not correct. Such ambiguity, though, may lead to multiple imprecisions both in research and practice when conversing about methods, concepts, and results. It seems surprising that despite of the frequent use of the terms, there is hardly any helpful scientific delineation. Thus, this paper aims to shed light on the relation of the two terms machine learning and artificial intelligence. We elaborate on the role of machine learning within instantiations of artificial intelligence, precisely within intelligent agents. To do so, we take a machine learning perspective on the capabilities of intelligent agents as well as the corresponding implementation. The contribution of our paper is threefold. First, we expand the theoretical framework of Russel and Norvig by further detailing the thinking layer of any intelligent agent by splitting it into separate learning and executing sublayers. Second, we show how this differentiation enables us to distinguish different contributions of machine learning for intelli-gent agents. Third, we draw on the implementations of the execution and learning sublayers (backend) to define a continuum between human involvement and agent autonomy. In the remainder of this paper, we first review relevant literature in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Next, we present and elaborate our conceptual framework which highlights the con-tribution of machine learning to artificial intelligence. On that basis, we derive an agenda for future research and conclude with a summary, current limitations, as well as an outlook. 2. Related work As a base for our conceptual work, we first review the different notions, concepts, or definitions of machine learning and artificial intelligence within extant research. In addition, we elaborate in greater detail on the theories which we draw upon in our framework. 2.1. Terminology Machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as the terms data mining, deep learning and statistical learning are related, often present in the same context and sometimes used interchangeably. While the terms are common in different communities, their particular usage and meaning varies widely. Proceedingsofthe5secondHawaiiInternationalConferenceonSystemSciences|URI: (CCBY-NC-ND4.0). General terminology used in this paper For instance, in the field of statistics the focus is on statistical learning, which is defined as a set of me-thods and algorithms to gain knowledge, predict outcomes, and make decisions by constructing models from a data set. From a statistics point of view, machine learning can be regarded as an implemen-tation of statistical learning. Within the field of computer science, machine learning has the focus of designing efficient algorithms to solve problems with computational resources. While machine learning utilizes approaches from statistics, it also includes methods which are not entirely based on previous work of statisticians-resulting in new and well-cited contri-butions to the field . Especially the method of deep learning raised increased interest within the past years. Deep learning models are composed of multiple processing layers which are capable of learning representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Deep learning has drastically improved the capabilities of machine learning, for example in speech or image recognition. In demarcation to the previous terms, data mining describes the process on how to apply quantitative analytical methods, which help to solve real-world problems, for example in business settings. In the case of machine learning, data mining is the process of generating meaningful machine learning models. The goal is not to develop further knowledge about machine learning algorithms, but to apply them to data in order to gain insights. Machine learning can therefore be seen as a foundation for data mining. In contrast, artificial intelligence applies techniques like machine learning, statistical learning or other techniques like descriptive statistics to mimic intelligence in machines. and the terms defined within this paragraph lay the foundation of the remainder of this work. However, the overall terminology and relationships of the concepts is discussed controversially. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to bring more insight to the terminology and more precisely, to clarify the role of machine learning within AI. To gain a broader understanding for the terms machine learning and AI, we examine both in further detail. 2.2. Machine learning Machine learning describes a set of techniques that are commonly used to solve a variety of real-world problems with the help of computer systems which can learn to solve a problem instead of being explicitly programmed. In general, we can differentiate between unsupervised and supervised machine learning. For the course of this work, we focus on the latter, as the most-widely used methods are of supervised nature. With regard to supervised machine learning, learning means that a series of examples (past experience) is used to build knowledge about a given task. Although statistical methods are used during the learning process, a manual adjustment or programming of rules or strategies to solve a problem is not requiredition In more detail, (supervised) machine learning techniques always aim to build a model by applying an algorithm on a set of known data points to gain insight on an unknown set of data . Statistical Learning Machine Learning Artifical Intelligenceapplies OthersData MiningProcessMethod set Instantiation describes application process of Others Others (for example Descriptive Statistics)Implementation Deep Learning Thus, the processes of creation of a machine learning model slightly vary in their definition of phases but typically employ the three main phases of model initiation, performance estimation and deployment : During the model initiation phase, a human user defines a problem, prepares and processes a data set and chooses a suitable machine learning algorithm for the given task. Then, during the performance estimation, various parameter permutations describing the algorithm are validated and a well-performing configuration is selected with respect to its performance in solving a specific task. Lastly, the model is deployed and put into practice to solve the task on unseen data. Learning in general depicts a key facet of a humans cognition which refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. Humans process a vast amount of information by utilizing abstract knowledge that helps us to better understand incoming input. Due to their adaptive nature, machine learning models are able to mimic the cognitive abilities of a human being in an isolated manner. However, machine learning solely represents a set of methods that enable to learn patterns in existing data, thus generating analytical models that can be utilized inside larger IT artifacts. 2.3. Artificial intelligence The topic of artificial intelligence (AI) is rooted in different research disciplines, such as computer science. philosophy. or futures studies. In this work, we mainly focus on the field of computer science, as it is the most relevant one in identifying the contribution of machine learning to AI and in differentiating both terms. AI research can be separated into different research streams. These streams differ on the one hand as to the objective of AI application (thinking versus acting), on the other hand as to the kind of decision making (targeting a human-like decision versus an ideal, rational decision). This distinction leads to four research currents which are depicted in. According to the Cognitive Modeling (that is thinking humanly) stream, an AI must be a machine with a mind. This also includes performing human thinking. not only based on the same output as a human when given the same input, but also on the same reasoning steps which led to the very conclusion. In this case, the terms rational and intelligent are used interchangeably in related work. The Laws of Thought stream (that is thinking rationally) requires an AI to arrive at the rational decision despite what a human might answer. Therefore, an AI must follow the laws of thought by using computational models which reflect logic. The Turing Test (that is acting humanly) stream implies that an AI must act intelligently when interacting with humans. To accomplish these tasks, an AI must perform human tasks at least as good as humans. These requirements can be tested by the Turing Test. Finally, the Rational Agent stream considers an AI as a rational or intelligent agent1. This agent does not only act autonomously but also with the objective to achieve the rationally ideal outcome. An alternative way to delineate AI is defining intelligence in general and using the resulting insights to create intelligent machines. Legg and Hutter use intelligence tests, theories of human intelligence and psychological definitions to define a measurement of intelligence. Based on their definition, they use an agent-environment framework to describe intelligence in general and-in case the agent is a machine-artificial intelligence in particular. Their framework exhibits many similarities to the acting rationally stream. Besides defining AI in general, the classification of AI is another topic in the field of AI research. Searle suggests differentiating between weak and strong A1. Whereas a weak AI only pretends to think, a strong AI is a mind with mental states. Gubrud however categorizes AI by taking the type of task into account. An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an AI which in general, that is in any domain, acts at least on the same level as a human brain, however without requiring Humanly Rationally Thinking Cognitive Modeling Laws of thought Acting Turing Test Rational Agent Application to Objective. AI research streams based on Russell and Norvig consciousness. In contrast, a narrow AI is an AI that rivals or exceeds the human brain only in specific, limited tasks. In the following, we will look into the Rational Agent stream in some more detail as it is of importance when regarding implementation of machine learning within AI. We will come back to the other three research streams in section where we show that they are compatible with our framework of an agent-based A1. According to the Rational Agent stream, the intelligence itself is manifested by the acting of agents. These agents are characterized by five features, namely they operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals. An agent defines its action not for itself but with an environment it interacts with. It recognizes the environment by its sensors, has an agent program to decide what to do with the input data, and performs an action with its actuators. To become a rational agent, the agent must also act to achieve the highest expected outcome according to this performance measure-based on the current and past knowledge of the environment and the possible actions. When it comes to the general demarcation of agents, according to Russel and Norvig, the agent program can be segmented into four different agent types : A simple reflex agent reacts only based on its sensor data whereas a model-based reflex agent also considers an internal state of the agent. A goal-based agent decides for the best decision to achieve its goals. The fulfilment of a goal is a binary decision which means it can either be fulfilled or not. On the contrast, a utility-based agent has no binary goal but a whole utility function which it tries to maximize. An agent can become a learning agent by extending its program. Such a learning agent then consists of a performance element which selects an action based on the sensor data and a learning element, which gets feedback from the environment, generates own problems, and improves the performance element if possible. The agent-environment framework consists of three components: an agent, an environment and a goal. Intelligence is the measurement for the agents ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. The agent gets input by perceptions generated from the environment. One type of perceptions are observations of the environment, while others are reward signals that indicate how well the goals of the agent are achievedition Based on these input signals, the agent decides to perform actions which are sent back as signals to the environment. 3. A framework for understanding the role of machine learning in artificial intelligence In order to understand the interplay of machine learning and AI, we base our concept on the framework of Russel and Norvig. With their differentiation between the two objectives of AI application, acting and thinking, they lay an important foundation. 3.1. Layers of agents When trying to understand the role of machine learning within AI, we need to take a perspective which has a focus on the implementation of intelligent agents. We require this perspective, as it allows us to map the different tasks and components of machine learning to the capabilities of intelligent agents. If we regard the capabilities of thinking and acting of an intelligent agent and translate this into the terms of software design, we can reason that the acting capabilities can be regarded as a frontend, while the thinking part can be regarded as a backend. Software engineers typically strictly separate form and function to allow for more flexibility and independence as well as to enable parallel development. The frontend is the interface the environment interacts with. It can take many forms. In the case of intelligent agents it can be a very abstract, machine-readable web interface. a human-readable application or even a humanoid template with elaborated expression capabilities. For the frontend to interact with the environment, it requires two technical components; sensors and actuators. Sensors detect events or changes in the environment and forward the information via the frontend to the backend. For instance, they can read the temperature within an industrial production machine or read visuals of an interaction with a human. Actuators on the other hand are components that are responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism. While sensors just process information, actuators act, for instance by automatically buying stocks or changing the facial expressions of a humanoid. One could argue that the Turing test takes place at the interaction of the environment with the frontend, more precisely the combination of sensors and actuators if one wants to test the agents AI of acting humanly. Despite every frontend having sensors and actuators, it is not of importance for our work what the precise frontend looks like; it is only relevant to note that a backend-independent, encapsulated frontend exists. Conceptual framework The backend provides the necessary functionalities, which depict the thinking capabilities of an intelligent agent. Therefore, the agent needs to learn and apply learned knowledge. In consequence, machine learning is relevant in this implementation layer. When regarding the case of supervised machine learning, we need to further differentiate between the process task that is building (=training) adequate machine learning models and the process task that is executing the deployed models. Therefore, to further understand the role of machine learning within intelligent agents, we refine the thinking layer of agents into a learning sublayer (model building) as well as an executing sublayer (model execution). Hence, we regard the necessary implementation for the learning sublayer as the learning backend, while the executing sublayer is denoted by the executing backend. 3.2. Types of learning The learning backend dictates first if the intelligent agent is able to learn, and, second, how the agent is able to learn, for example, which precise algorithms it uses, what type of data processing is applied, how concept Russel and Norvig indicate a related relationship by differentiating into learning elements and performance elements. drift is handled, and so on Therefore, we pick up on the terminology from Russel and Norvig by regarding two different types of intelligent agents: simple-reflex agents as well as learning agents. This differentiation especially holds for a machine learning perspective on AI, as it considers whether the underlying models in the thinking layer are once trained and never touched again (simple-reflex)-or continuously updated and adaptive (learning). In recent literature, suitable examples for both can be found. As an example for simple-reflex agents, Oroszi and Ruhland build and deploy an early warning system of pneumonia in hospitals : While building and testing the model for the agent shows convincing results, the adaptive learning of the system after deployment might be critical. Other examples of agents with single-trained models are common in different areas, for instance for anaphora resolutions. prediction of pedestrians or object annotation. On the other hand, recent literature also gives examples for learning agents. Mitchell et al. present the concept of never-ending learning agents which have a strong focus on continuously building and updating models within agents. An example for such an agent is shown by Liebman et al. who build a self-learning agent for music playlist recommendations. Other cases are for instance the regulation of heat pump thermostats. an agent to acquire collective knowledge over different tasks or learning word meanings. The choice on this feature in general (simple-reflex versus learning agent) influences the overall design of the agent as well as the contribution of machine learning. The overview of our resulting framework is depicted in. In conclusion, in the case of a simple-reflex agent, machine learning takes places as a once-trained model in the execution sublayer. In contrast, it plays a role in the learning sublayer of a learning agent to continuously improve the model in the execution sublayer. This improvement is based on knowledge and feedback, which is derived from the environment via the execution layer. 3.3. Continuum between human involvement and machine involvement When it comes to the executing backend and the learning backend, it is not only of importance if and how underlying machine learning models are updated-but how much automated the necessary processes are. Every machine learning task involves various process steps, including data source selection, data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluating, deploying, executing and improving (for example. ). While a discussion of the individual steps is beyond the scope of this paper, the autonomy and the automation of these tasks as an implementation within the agent is of particular interest in each necessary task of the machine learning lifecycle. For instance, while the execution of a once-built model can be fairly easily automated, the automated identification of an adequate data source for a new problem or retraining as well as a self-induced model building are more difficult. Therefore, we need to view the human involvement in the necessary machine learning tasks of an intelligent agent, as depicted in. While it is hard to draw a clear line between all possible forms of human involvement in the machine learning-relevant tasks of an intelligent agent, we see this phenomenon rather as a continuum. The continuum ranges between none or little agent autonomy with full human involvement (for example-) on the one extreme as well as the full agent autonomy and no or little human involvement for the delivered task on the other (for example-). For example, an intelligent agent with the task to autonomously drive a car considering the traffic signs already proves a high degree of agent autonomy. However, if the agent is confronted with a new traffic sign, the learning of this new circumstance might still need human involvement as the agent might not be able to completely learn by itself. Therefore, the necessary involvement of humans, especially in the thinking layer (= executing backend and learning backend), is of major interest when describing AI and the underlying machine learning models. The degree of autonomy for each step of machine learning can be investigated and may help to characterize the autonomy of an agent in terms of the related machine learning tasks. 4. Research priorities for machine-learning-enabled artificial intelligence The presented framework of machine learning and its role within intelligent agents is still on a conceptual level. However, given the misunderstandings and ambiguity of the two terms. we see potential for further research with the aim both to clarify the terminology and to map uncharted territory for machine-learning enabled artificial intelligence. First, empiric validation as well as continuous, iterative development of the framework is necessary. We need to identify various cases of intelligent agents across different disciplines and to evaluate how well the framework fits. It would be interesting to see how practical and academic machine-learning-enabled artificial intelligence projects map to the framework, and, furthermore even quantify which share of such projects works with learning agents and which with non-learning agents. Additionally, such cases would help us to gain a better understanding of the necessary human involvement in state-of-the art intelligent agents-and, therefore, determine the degree of autonomy when regarding all aspects (acting, executing, learning) of such agents. Second, one aspect of interest would be to reduce the necessary involvement of humans. As stated before, we see this spectrum as a continuum between human involvement and agent autonomy. Two possibilities come immediately to mind. The methods of transfer machine learning deal with possibilities on how to transfer knowledge (that is, models) from one source environment to a target environment. This could indeed help to minimize human involvement, as further research in this field could show possibilities and application-oriented techniques to utilize transfer. Degree of agent autonomy and human involvement machine learning for automated adaption of novel or modified tasks. Additionally, regarding already deployed models as part of the backend-layer, it is of interest not only how the models are built initially, but how to deal with changes in the environment. The so-called subfield of concept drift holds many possibilities on how to detect changes and adapt models-however, fields of successful application remain rare . 5. Conclusion In this paper, we clarify the role of machine learning within artificial intelligence-in particular intelligent agents. We present a framework, which highlights the two cases of simple-reflex and learning agents as well as the role machine learning can play in each of them. In a nutshell, machine learning models can be implemented as once-trained models within an intelligent agent-without the possibility to learn additional insights from the environment (simple reflex agent). Implementation-wise, we call this sublayer of executing knowledge the executing backend. In this case, the agent is able to utilize (previously built) machine learning models-but not build and update its own ones. If the agent, however, is able to learn from its environment and is, therefore, able to update the machine learning models within the execution sublayer, it is a learning agent. Learning agents have an additional sublayer, the learning backend, which allows them to utilize machine learning in terms of model building/training. When it comes to the implementation of these two sublayers, it is of importance to capture the degree of autonomy that the machine learning within the agent requires. This aspect focusses on the human involvement in the necessary machine learning tasks, for example the data collection or the choice of an algorithm. The research at hand is still in a conceptual state and has certain limitations. First, while the proposed framework allows to deepen the understanding of machine learning within AI, empirical studies are still required to see how well existing machine-learning-enabled AI applications fit into this scheme. Expert interviews with AI designers could validate the model and complete and evaluate the level of detail. Furthermore, we need to find ways to quantify the human involvement in machine-learning related tasks within AI to gain better understanding of the degree of autonomy of state-of-the-art agents. Although at an early stage, our framework should allow scientists and practitioners to be more precise when referring to machine learning and A1. It highlights the importance of not using the terms interchangeably but making clear which role machine learning plays within a specific agent implementation.
